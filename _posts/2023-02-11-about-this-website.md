Welcome to my personal space where I share my notes and things I learn on various topics:

* Computer Vision
* Remote Sensing
* Machine Learning
* Multi-object tracking
* Sensor Data Fusion
* Python
* C++

## Why this, why now

During my self-learning adventures, I invested heavily in books, courses, and countless hours reading scientific articles and watching videos on YouTube.

Much of my effort went into filtering what was worth learning from what was a waste of time. Something very complicated to do, especially nowadays where everything is trying to get our attention.

So, in the last 20 years I've learned a lot and I want to share relevant information with you, helping you to focus on what really matters.

I think I can help you with something!
